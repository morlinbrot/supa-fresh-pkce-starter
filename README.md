# Supa Fresh PKCE Starter

Boilerplate for a Deno Fresh web app with [Supabase SSR authentication](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) styling.

Supabase SSR authentication is provided by the [fresh-plugin-supabase](https://github.com/morlinbrot/fresh-plugin-supabase) plugin, another project of mine. This is the frontend boilerplate to get going immediately, adding the routes and islands that the plugin requires plus some more components to provide a minimal layout.

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task dev
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
